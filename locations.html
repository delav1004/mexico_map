                Guanajuato is a central state of Mexico, known as the cradle of the country's independence. Its capital,
                with the same name, houses the granary of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, where the first battle against
                Spain in the 19th century took place. The former mining town is also famous for its steep cobblestone
                streets lined with colonial architecture and picturesque garden squares, such as the Jardín de la Unión.
                Many tourists and locals consider this city to be the most beautiful in Mexico. The city is built on
                very hilly ground, so virtually every point in the city is on a slant. The city has a network of
                underground tunnels that serve as roads making this place unique in the world.

                Tequila is a town in the state of Jalisco, in Mexico, and is located about 60 km from the city of
                Guadalajara. The name of Tequila comes from the Nahuatl word "Tecuilan" (Place of tributes). It is the
                head of the municipality of the same name. Tequila is known for giving tequila its name, being one of
                the territories where it is produced. Its primitive settlers were Chichimecas, Otomi, Toltecs and
                Nahuatlacas. The town was initially settled in a place called Teochichán or Techinchán: place of the
                almighty god or where snares and traps abound.

            <h1>Paso de Cortés</h1>
            <p>
                Popocatepetl is currently a very active volcano with forested slopes and a large crater. It is the
                second-highest peak in Mexico, behind Pico de Orizaba and is generally considered the fifth-highest
                mountain in North America. Popocatepetl is Aztec for "Smoking Mountain"; also known as Popo. Popo and
                its neighbouring volcano Iztaccihuatl dominate the sky east of Amecameca. They are located less than 80
                km from Mexico City and are separated from each other by ten miles of high grounds referred to as Paso
                de Cortes. When there is low volcanic activity, the Paso de Cortés can be reached either from the town
                of Amecameca by a winding paved road or from Santiago Xalitzintla, in Puebla. However, since 1994,
                access to the Popocatépetl volcano and the abandoned Tlamacas lodge has been limited.

            <p>
                Teotihuacán is a large Mexican archaeological complex northeast of Mexico City. Through the center of
                the place, which was once a flourishing pre-Columbian city, passes the Calzada de los Muertos. This
                unites the Temple of Quetzalcóatl, the Pyramid of the Moon and the Pyramid of the Sun. The last two have
                panoramic views from their tops. Artifacts at the on-site Museo de la Cultura Teotihuacana include
                pottery and bone work.

            <h1>Mexico City</h1>
            <p>
                In Mexico City, life is as intense as its own urban layout. Within the same street it is possible to
                find the most sophisticated buildings coexisting with archaeological remains and traditional street food
                stalls. The city seamlessly intertwines tradition and modernity in just a few meters' distance. The
                ancient Tenochitlán, capital of the Aztecs, is today a magical, powerful, and vibrant city that
                overflows what it occupies and that, as its inhabitants say, "never ends". Mexico City is the largest
                city in North America, whose dimensions and population size make it one of the largest cities in the
                world. It is the main urban, social, political, academic, economic, tourist, artistic, business, and
                cultural nucleus of the Mexican nation, and the city has witnessed many significant events in the
                nation's history, making it a crucial part of the country's identity. Mexico City is, after London, the
                city in the world with the largest number of museums, where the rich pre-Columbian heritage of Mexico is
                preserved. More than 160 museums, 100 art galleries, 30 concert halls and a historic center that
                reflects the country's colonial history, make Mexico City one of the most relevant and tourist-important
                Latin American cultural enclaves that exist. </p>

            <p>
                Oaxaca is a central state of Mexico, known as the cradle of the country's independence. Its capital,
                with the same name, houses the granary of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, where the first battle against
                Spain in the 19th century took place. The former mining town is also famous for its steep cobblestone
                streets lined with colonial architecture and picturesque garden squares, such as the Jardín de la Unión.
                Many tourists and locals consider this city to be the most beautiful in Mexico. The city is built on
                very hilly ground, so virtually every point in the city is on a slant. The city has a network of
                underground tunnels that serve as roads making this place unique in the world.

                Mazunte is an old fishing village on the southern coast of Mexico, nestled in an exceptional natural
                setting. Mazunte has opted for sustainable tourism where visitors can enjoy tranquility and relaxation,
                but also excursions, water activities such as surfing, and dreamy sunsets. Since time immemorial,
                turtles have come to this paradisiacal place to lay their eggs, which is why the Mexican Turtle Center
                was created here. In this complex, research is conducted and the conservation of the numerous species of
                marine and land turtles that inhabit Mexico is promoted.

                Cancun is a city located on the Yucatan peninsula that borders the Caribbean Sea and is known for its
                beaches, numerous tourist centers, and nightlife. With its powdery white sand beaches, turquoise blue

                Mexico's most popular tourist destinations. Here, visitors can enjoy endless days at the beach, while
                having a refreshing drink. Some of the most beautiful beaches in the hotel zone are Playa Gaviota Azul
                and Playa Delfines, the latter is a great option for people looking for moderate or intense waves.

                Palenque is a pre-Hispanic city dating back to the 3rd century. It was one of the most notable cities of
                the Mayan world and also served as a ceremonial center thanks to Mayan patrons interested in
                demonstrating their power. It was one of the most important Mayan cities of its time, on par with
                Calakmul and Tikal. The current population is composed of indigenous peoples such as the Chol, Tzeltal,
                and Lacandon. Palenque is located in the heart of southeastern Mexico, in the northeast of the state of
                Chiapas, in an area of high tropical jungle where waterfalls and rivers abound.

                One of the Seven Wonders of the World, Chichen Itza, is a magnificent example of the advanced
                civilization of the Mayan people. It is located in the state of Yucatan, 128 km from Merida in the
                direction of Cancun, and receives more than one million tourists every year, making it the second most
                visited archaeological site in Mexico, after Teotihuacan. It was founded by Mayan groups between the
                years 325 and 550 AD. Around the year 800, the Toltecs invaded the area, causing the fusion of the two
                cultures. Thus, the city reached its maximum splendor and became the most powerful in the Yucatan
                Peninsula in the early 12th century.
